# Memory Game Project

This is for the project by the course "Front-end Web Developer Nonodegree" from [Udacity](www.Udacity.com)

## What is this?

This is a game to improve your memory by matching 2 cards.


## How to play?

1. You can click and open whatever you want and have to match 2 cards by memorizing cards you opened.
2. You can open only 2 cards one time and the open cards will be flipped back over if 2 cards don't match.
3. There are total 16 cards and 8 pairs of cards which have the same icons.
4. You can get 3 stars when the 'moves' is to 13 and 2 stars when the 'moves' is from 14 to 17. From 18, I'm sorry that you can get only 1 star.
5. Limit time is 10 minutes. (enough time to have lunch during the game!)
6. Just Enjoy it!


## How to build?

Basic template was provided by Udacity and I input codes for Javascript and some parts of HTML and CSS. As a beginner, I studied codes and how to manipulate them from many websites, for this reason I refered to some parts of Javascript codes. I didn't coppy all the codes, but if you find some problems or plagiarization, please let me know.
Thanks and just enjoy this.
